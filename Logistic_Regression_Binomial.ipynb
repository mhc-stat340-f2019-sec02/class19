    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to learn how to apply logistic regression to count data where the number of \"1\"s is restricted.\n",
    "Like logistic regression for a Bernoulli distributed variable, we'll explore Binomially-distributed random variables and how to model the probability of 'success' conditional on covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function will map an inner product of coefficients and covariates to the interval between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also find the likelihood for this model and show how it generalizes our model of logistic regression for a Bernoulli distributed random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binomial distributed random variable\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable $Y$ is Binomially distributed if, given a set of independent **trials** the probability of observing $s$ successes (sometimes denoted 1s) is\n",

    "The expression\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p^{s}\n",

    "\n",
    "is the probability of observing a string of $s$ 1s with probability $p$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(1-p)^{N-s}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the probability of observing a string of $N-s$ 0s with probability $1-p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the probability of observing a string of $s$ 1s and $N-s$ 0s equals\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p^{s} (1-p)^{N-s}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But the binomial distribution does not consider the order of 1s and 0s.\n",
    "Instead, the binomial distribution computes the probability of observing $s$ 1s among $N$ trials in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binomial operator counts the number of ways $s$ 1s can occur among $N$ trials--$\\binom{N}{s}$.\n",

    "The first term counts the number of ways $s$ 1s can occupy any of $N$ different positions.\n",
    "For example, given $N=10$ different possibilites and $s=4$ 1s, the first 1 can occupy the 4th position, secon 1 can occupy the 1st position, third 1 can occupy the 8th position, and fourth 1 can occupy the 7th position.\n",
    "In general, the first 1 has N different options.\n",
    "After the first 1 occupies one of the N different spaces, the second one now has only N-1 spaces to choose from.\n",
    "Finally, the s$^{th}$ 1 has $N-s$ spaces to choose from.\n",
    "We can write this as \n",

    "\n",
    "But the above ratio of factorial counts the number of positions each distinct 1 can occupy.\n",
    "We are not interested in the distinction between the first, second, or fourth 1.\n",
    "For every way to occupy spaces above, we could have chosen any of the $s$ 1s.\n",
