    "\n",
    "Our goal is to learn how to apply logistic regression to count data where the number of \"1\"s is restricted.\n",
    "Like logistic regression for a Bernoulli distributed variable, we'll explore Binomially-distributed random variables and how to model the probability of 'success' conditional on covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function will map an inner product of coefficients and covariates to the interval between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also find the likelihood for this model and show how it generalizes our model of logistic regression for a Bernoulli distributed random variable.\n",

    "But the binomial distribution does not consider the order of 1s and 0s.\n",
